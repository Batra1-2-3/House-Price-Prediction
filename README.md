The dataset contains the following columns:

- date
- price
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- sqft_living
- sqft_lot
- floors
- waterfront
- view
- condition
- sqft_above
- sqft_basement
- yr_built

- street
- city
- statezip
- country

## Features Used for Prediction

The project uses the following features for prediction:

- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- City

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

## Code Structure
The code is structured as follows:

House_Price_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data analysis, preprocessing, model building, and prediction.
data.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for the project.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project, instructions, and prerequisites.

## Result
After running the code, you will get predictions for house prices based on the specified features.
